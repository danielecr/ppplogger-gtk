This is ppplogger-gtk.

ppplogger-gtk report pppd log and does simple calc on traffic and time
consume of connection (billing calculation).

It is named -gtk even if it use libgnomeui (due to lack of GnomeDate
widget in Gtk) and gconfd system for storing database connection data
(keys: /apps/ppplogger/dbcon/x)

You need the companion program pppd-logger in order to update database
with pppd connections. It also require a MySql database correctly
setted up.

Just ./configure; make; make install
