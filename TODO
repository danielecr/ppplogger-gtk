- Maybe add support for sqlite and other backend (think about using
   libgda if it is needed/better/cleaner)

- Refactor code (yes, it is awful now, I know)

- Clean glade Interface

- add ongoing connection logging (look at ioctl? start time from db
   not closed? timer ticker for update? yes, just that and 4 field in
   interface for current connection time,traffic,time cost, traffic
   cost ... how to manage more ongoing connection??? ComboBox)

- remove X K/M/Gbytes from traffic (text+combo) per cost

- say more "ciao", "buongiorno", "arrivederci", etc. : it is good in
   general

- write a poem
