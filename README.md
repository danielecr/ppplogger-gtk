# ppp-logger-gtk

This is a old project and code. It is based on old version of gtk, and was
used to take control about expense on time based connection.

I develop this code in 2004, it is based on a mysql database tables
filled up by a perl script that parse text log in `/var/log/messages`.

Nowaday this technics is superseed by tools like fluentd or influxdb,
that simply does not need boilerplate, support windowing, and has plenty of
output channels.

Also visualization tools available are more advanced and more cool and
nice to read and understand.

So, this code may have just historical interest, or it may be of use
for some specific system that does not have resource or compatibility
with the up-to-date software available.

In 2004 git was not a thing, github.com neither. Debian and apt-get was already there.
Does not sounds crazy how long a technology stay alive when it is well designed?
